# Flask

- [Making Static site with flask](https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2012/dead-easy-yet-powerful-static-website-generator-with-flask/)
  Great ideas here. Simple code using Flask-FlatPages and Flask-Frozen to make a nice site and
  then render it static. Although may not need flask Flask-FlatPages, can write what I need to do that.

- [Another static site with flask](http://royprins.com/add-flatpages-to-flatfreeze)
  Also using Flask-FlatPages and Flask-Frozen. Nice code to use as reference.


## Packages that look useful

- Flask-Admin
- Flassk-AppBuilder
