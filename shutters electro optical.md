Pockels Cell is solid state equivalent of Kerr Cell. Kerr Cell uses nitro-benzene (toxic) and KV to change birefringence. Transmission is about 30%. Pockels cell uses KD*P crystal.


Pockels Cell Suppliers
- [40 mm f/20 beam Pockets Cell](http://www.meadowlark.com/pockels-cell-modulator-p-110#.VbPlZXgUpSU) These are perfect! Could put behind lens.	Our longitudinal Pockels Cells are often used in polarimetry on imaging light beams and in the chopping of polarized beams. They consist of Z-cut KD\*P crystals between protective windows that have transparent indium-tin oxide electrodes applied to their interior faces. The electrodes produce a uniform electric field normal to the optical faces and permit use of a thin (approximately 3 mm) KD*P crystal. Nanosecond switching time.

[Gatable ICCD Cameras](http://www.stanfordcomputeroptics.com/technology/high-speed-shutter.html) Typical shutter speeds are nano second. Can co sub nano second.

[XXRapidFrame Camera](http://www.stanfordcomputeroptics.com/products/iccd-framing-camera.html#features)  Comes with 4 iccd cameras that can also be used individually. Can also do multi spectral with the individual channels.

# Rapatronic Shutter

Could have set of SLRs for high res with the shutters.

Supposedly 10 ns shutter time.

- [rapatronic archive](http://edgerton-digital-collections.org/techniques/rapatronic-shutter) Diagrams of shutter
- [electro optical shutters Andrew DavidHazy](https://people.rit.edu/andpph/text-high-speed.html) Good page. He says kerr cell can go to 5 ns.
- [electro optical shutters](http://home.earthlink.net/~jimlux/hv/eo.htm) Comments on cost. Kerr cels in large size may be cheaper.

# Image intensifier shutter

[image intensifier shutter](http://www.stanfordcomputeroptics.com/products/image-intensifier-module.html#technical-details) Can go town to pico second. Would work with a phantom, has f-mount.
