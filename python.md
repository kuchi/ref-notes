## Animation

Blender with python seems like best for visualization.
- [Blender python animation script](http://blenderscripting.blogspot.com/2012/09/python-driven-animaion.html)
- [Matplotlib Using moviepy](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/11/29/data-animations-with-python-and-moviepy/)
- [Pyglet video of 3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhZypHWNyVY)

## Command processors
For making a console like program with commands

- [cmd python standard module](http://pymotw.com/2/cmd/)
- [cmd3](http://cloudmesh.github.io/cmd3/) Improved version of cmd

## Logging
- [Excellent logging tips and setup](http://victorlin.me/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python)
- [Zen of logging](https://glenfant.wordpress.com/2012/12/22/the-zen-of-logging-and-yaml/)

## Click command line interface
- [common options](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/click/issues/108) Good example of doing common options



## Utilities

- [AppDir](https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs): Gets application / user
directories that are platform specific.


## Image / Video processing
- moviepy
- imageio

## Config files
- [Anyconfig](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyconfig/0.0.6)
- [Click-config](https://github.com/EverythingMe/click-config) click yaml config
- [Configure](http://configure.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) Powerful yaml based
config library. Looks useful. But not compatible with python 3 and seems inactive.
- [layered-yaml-attrdict-config](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/layered-yaml-attrdict-config/) Seems active.

## Signal processing

- [Periodograms Irregular Spaced Data Fourier](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/06/13/lomb-scargle-in-python/) For irregular spaced data, essentially fourier frequency analysis.


## Misc

- Turn off tracebacks: `sys.tracebacklimit=0`.

## Visualization Libraries
- Vispy: Rapidly developing, looking good and plotting now there.
- Bokeh: Substantially improved. May be able to make plot server to view the cines with data synced. They have a way to downsample large data sets from the server.


## Web UI from command line scripts

- [wooey](https://github.com/mfitzp/Wooey) Automated web ui from python scripts
- [django-djangui](https://github.com/Chris7/django-djangui) Converst argparse script to browser ui

## Yaml
