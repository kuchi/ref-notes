## projectpoints projecting 3d to 2d augmented reality

- [opencv tutorial pose estimation](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_calib3d/py_pose/py_pose.html) Draws axss & cube on image. Good.
- [pose estimation from planes & markers](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/programming-computer-vision/9781449341916/ch04.html) From Programming Computer Vision w/ Python. **GOOD EXAMPLES**
  - Section 4.3. I have this book. Project a cube onto image.
  - Section 4.4 talks about using pygame and opengl for augmented reality. They project a teapot onto the image with good detail. Might be a good way to do the 3d dic data.
  - Looks like best format for 3d objects is the [obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) format for using with opengl & pygame.
